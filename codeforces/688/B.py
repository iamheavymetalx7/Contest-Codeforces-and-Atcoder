For simplifications, in the following solution we define lovely integer as an even-length positive palindrome number.

An even-length positive integer is lovely if and only if the first half of its digits is equal to the reverse of the second half.

So if a and b are two different 2k-digit lovely numbers, then the first k digits of a and b differ in at least one position.

So a is smaller than b if and only if the first half of a is smaller than the the first half of b.

Another useful fact: The first half of a a lovely number can be any arbitrary positive integer.

Using the above facts, it's easy to find the first half of the n-th lovely number â€” it exactly equals to integer n. When we know the first half of a lovely number, we can concatenate it with its reverse to restore the lovely integer. To sum up, the answer can be made by concatenating n and it's reverse together.
