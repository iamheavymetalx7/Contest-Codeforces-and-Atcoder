Note that the size of the array 
doesn't change parity, since it 
always decreases by 2. Let's count 
the number of distinct elements, 
call it x.

If x is the same parity as n
 (the length of the array), 
 then we can make sure all of 
 these x distinct elements 
 stay in the array by removing 
 two elements at a time.

Otherwise, x isn't the same 
parity as x. Then x-1 is the 
same parity as n, and we can 
make sure x-1 distinct elements stay
 in the array by removing two
  elements at a time. So the 
  answer is x if x and n have 
  the same parity, and xâˆ’1 otherwise.
